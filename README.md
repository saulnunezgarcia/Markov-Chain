# Markov-Chain
Markov chains were applied to simulate the time evolution of the 137Cs released in the atmosphere as a
result of the incident in Chernobyl nuclear power plant in 1986. The different possible paths that the radioactive
elements could take to eventually reach humans were considered. The main source of contamination for humans
was found to be the consumption of contaminated vegetables.
